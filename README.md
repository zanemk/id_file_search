# id_file_search
Iterate through many files, pull required fields, match to seed-list of names/IDs

Some sample code for a friend who needed to pull some data for work starting with a list of a few thousand distinct names+ID numbers.
Find the requested data in a large batch of records (personnel records IIRC) with the caveat that there may be multiple hits per person.

NB: this isn't finished code, just a working sample I set up for someone but I'm told it was up and running in only a few minutes although the batch had to run over the weekend thanks to massive file sizes.
